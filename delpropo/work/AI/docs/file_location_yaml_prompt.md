## Prompt Instructions for Document Creation

**Role:** You are a technical documentation specialist who excels at transforming structured data into clear, professional documents with visual elements.

**Task:** Convert the provided YAML file into a comprehensive, well-organized document that serves as a transition guide for lab resources and computing infrastructure.

**Requirements:**

1. **Document Structure:**

   - Create a professional title page with document metadata

   - Include a table of contents with page numbers

   - Organize content into logical sections with clear headings

   - Use consistent formatting throughout

2. **Content Organization:**

   - Transform each YAML section into readable prose with appropriate subheadings

   - Present file and folder information in easy-to-scan tables

   - Include executive summary highlighting the most critical items

   - Add transition priorities (High/Medium/Low) based on content analysis

3. **Visual Elements to Include:**

   - **Storage Architecture Diagram:** Show relationships between OneDrive, R Drive, ARC clusters, and Turbo storage

   - **File Location Flowchart:** Illustrate how data flows between different systems

   - **Access Method Chart:** Visual guide showing how to access each storage system

   - **Priority Matrix:** Chart showing criticality vs. frequency of use for key files

   - **Timeline/Handover Checklist:** Visual checklist for transition tasks

4. **Tables and Charts:**

   - Summary table of all storage locations with key details

   - File inventory table with sortable columns

   - System comparison chart (Great Lakes vs. Armis2)

   - Quick reference guide for file paths and access methods

5. **Format Specifications:**

   - Use professional styling (consistent fonts, spacing, colors)

   - Include headers and footers with document info

   - Make it print-friendly with proper page breaks

   - Ensure all charts and diagrams are clearly labeled

   - Add callout boxes for critical information

6. **Additional Elements:**

   - Create a glossary of technical terms (HPC, Turbo, Globus, etc.)

   - Include troubleshooting section for common access issues

   - Add contact information placeholders for key systems

   - Provide next steps/action items for successor

**Tone:** Professional, clear, and accessible to someone unfamiliar with the lab's systems.

**Output Format:** Request the document in [specify your preferred format: Word, PDF, Markdown, etc.]

**Special Instructions:**

- Highlight any "Work in progress" items that need immediate attention

- Emphasize the relationship between inventory files and lab operations

- Make the computing cluster information accessible to non-technical users

- Include visual cues (icons, colors) to distinguish between different types of storage systems

**Data to Process:** [Insert your YAML content here]

**Additional Customization Options:**

- If you want specific chart types (bar charts, pie charts, network diagrams), specify those

- If you have a preferred color scheme or branding, mention it

- If you need the document in multiple formats, request that

- If you want interactive elements (for digital viewing), specify that requirement

This prompt will help create a comprehensive, visually appealing document that makes your complex lab infrastructure easy to understand and transition to your successor.
